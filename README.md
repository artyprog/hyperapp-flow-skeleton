This is a minimal boilerplate I've put together to easily get started with [hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp). It uses [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) for building, and [flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) for type checking.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to a folder of your choosing
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`
3. Run the dev server: `npm start` or `yarn start`
4. Build for production: `npm run build` or `yarn build`

## Considerations

### Linting

My preferred linter is Standard, however the majority of JavaScript users seem to favor AirBnB and Google styles instead. To prevent any discrepancies, I've decided to let the user install whichever linting solution they please.
