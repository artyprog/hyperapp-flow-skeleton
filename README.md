This is a minimal boilerplate I've put together to easily get started with [hyperapp](hyperapp). It uses [webpack](webpack) for building, and [flow](flow) for type checking.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to a folder of your choosing
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`
3. Run the dev server: `npm start` or `yarn start`
4. Build for production: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
